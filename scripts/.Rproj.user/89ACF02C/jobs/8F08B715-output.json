Data from various service types, including aesthetics, barbering & hairdressing, and nails, were examined to determine inspection pass rates. The results show that a significant majority of establishments pass their inspections, with only a small fraction receiving conditional passes or closures. These findings highlight the overall compliance in the industry and point to potential areas for regulatory improvements. This study enhances our understanding of regulatory effectiveness and compliance in the personal care sector.'\n  bibliography:\n    - references.bib\n  \n"]
