Here is the modified R code using the `tidyverse` package to simulate a dataset similar to the one you described:

### R Code Using `tidyverse` to Simulate a Dataset

```r
# Load the necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Define the number of records
n <- 100

# Simulate establishment IDs
estId <- sample(9000000:9500000, n, replace = TRUE)

# Simulate establishment names
estName <- paste("Establishment", 1:n)

# Simulate full addresses
addrFull <- paste(sample(100:999, n, replace = TRUE), "DUNDAS ST", sample(c("E", "W"), n, replace = TRUE))

# Simulate service types
srvType <- sample(c("Aesthetics", "Barbering & Hairdressing", "Nails", "Tattooing", "Body Piercing"), n, replace = TRUE)

# Simulate inspection status
insStatus <- sample(c("Pass", "Fail", "Pending"), n, replace = TRUE)

# Simulate inspection dates
insDate <- sample(seq(as.Date("2023-01-01"), as.Date("2024-12-31"), by = "day"), n, replace = TRUE)

# Simulate observations
observation <- sample(c("No infractions observed", "Minor infractions observed", "Major infractions observed"), n, replace = TRUE)

# Simulate infraction category
infCategory <- sample(c("None", "Hygiene", "Safety"), n, replace = TRUE)

# Simulate fine amounts
fineAmount <- round(runif(n, 0, 500), 2)

# Create the simulated dataset using tidyverse functions
simulated_data <- tibble(
  estId = estId,
  estName = estName,
  addrFull = addrFull,
  srvType = srvType,
  insStatus = insStatus,
  insDate = insDate,
  observation = observation,
  infCategory = infCategory,
  fineAmount = fineAmount
)

# Print the first few rows of the simulated dataset
print(simulated_data)
```

### Key Changes:
- **`tibble()`** from the `tidyverse` package is used to create the dataset instead of `data.frame()`.
- All other manipulations and simulations remain the same but are now streamlined using `tidyverse` style.

This will simulate a dataset and print the first few rows for you. Let me know if you'd like any additional customizations!

The dataset you've provided seems to contain information about inspections for various establishments, including details such as:
- `estName`: The name of the establishment.
- `srvType`: The type of service (e.g., Aesthetics, Barbering & Hairdressing).
- `insStatus`: The inspection status (e.g., Pass).
- `insDate`: The date of inspection.
- `observation`: Notes or observations made during the inspection.

With this data, we can create plots in R such as:
1. **A bar plot showing the number of establishments by service type (`srvType`)**.
2. **A time series plot showing inspections over time (`insDate`)**.

### Full R Code for Plotting:

1. **Bar Plot of Establishments by Service Type**:

```r
# Install necessary packages
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("readr")

# Load the necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)

# Load the data (replace the path with your actual file path)
cdv_data <- read_csv("path/to/data1.csv")

# Plot 1: Bar plot showing the count of establishments by service type (srvType)
ggplot(cdv_data, aes(x = srvType)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Number of Establishments by Service Type", x = "Service Type", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
write r code to do some plotting about this cdv data
2. **Time Series Plot of Inspections Over Time**:

```r
# Convert the insDate column to Date type
cdv_data <- cdv_data %>%
  mutate(insDate = as.Date(insDate, format = "%Y-%m-%d"))

# Plot 2: Time series plot showing the number of inspections over time
ggplot(cdv_data, aes(x = insDate)) +
  geom_line(stat = "count", color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Inspections Over Time", x = "Inspection Date", y = "Number of Inspections") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

### What this Code Does:
1. **Bar Plot**:
   - This plot shows the number of establishments by service type (e.g., Aesthetics, Barbering & Hairdressing).
   - The `geom_bar` function counts the number of occurrences for each service type and plots a bar for each.

2. **Time Series Plot**:
   - This plot visualizes how the number of inspections has changed over time. It uses the `insDate` column to map the inspection dates and count how many inspections were done on each date.

### Steps to Run:
1. Copy and paste this code into an R script in RStudio.
2. Replace `"path/to/data1.csv"` with the actual file path to your data file.
3. Run the script to generate the plots.

just three plotting using r code

Here are three sample plots you can generate with this data using R. I'll provide the code for:

Bar Plot: Number of establishments by service type (srvType).
Pie Chart: Proportion of inspection statuses (insStatus).
Time Series Plot: Number of inspections over time (insDate).
Here is the R code for each:

1. Bar Plot: Number of Establishments by Service Type
r
复制代码
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Bar plot of establishments by service type
ggplot(data, aes(x = srvType)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Number of Establishments by Service Type", x = "Service Type", y = "Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
2. Pie Chart: Proportion of Inspection Statuses
r
复制代码
# Calculate the proportion of each inspection status
status_count <- table(data$insStatus)
status_prop <- prop.table(status_count)

# Create a pie chart
pie(status_prop, labels = paste(names(status_prop), round(status_prop*100, 1), "%"), 
    main = "Proportion of Inspection Statuses", col = rainbow(length(status_prop)))
3. Time Series Plot: Number of Inspections Over Time
r
复制代码
# Convert the inspection date to a Date format
data$insDate <- as.Date(data$insDate)

# Create a time series plot of inspections over time
ggplot(data, aes(x = insDate)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 30, fill = "darkgreen", color = "white") +
  labs(title = "Number of Inspections Over Time", x = "Inspection Date", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
These three plots cover different aspects of your dataset. Let me know if you want to tweak any of them further!
